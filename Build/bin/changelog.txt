Version 1.4.3 (2016-08-11)
 * Maintenance release, no new features
 * Upgraded to new compiler toolset
 * Removed Windows XP as I can also no longer test it and as Visual Studio 2015
   no longer supports this platform.
 * Use more modern UI elements

Version 1.4.1/1.4.2 (2014-07-17)

 * Fixed screensaver muting: It sometimes happened that WinMute
   muted Windows Audio for no apparent reason and "forgot" to
   unmute. This is now fixed.

Version 1.4 (2014-07-10)

 * WinMute can now also mute if the screensaver starts
   Due to windows restrictions, unmuting the audio can take up to one second
   after the screensaver resumes.

 * Added a toggle switch to configure if WinMute should unmute at all after
   a workstation lock or a screensaver run

Version 1.3 (2012-02-23)

 * Right-click menu is now correctly dismissed if the user clicks somewhere
   outside of the menu.

 * Embedded Visual C++ 2010 DLLs. This increases file size by about 100kb, but
   enables the usage of this tool in workplaces that do not have deployed the
   Visual C++ 2010 Runtime Environment yet.

 * Vista/7/8: Correctly mute the new device, if the default audio endpoint
   changes.

 * XP: Greatly improved hardware detection code. WinMute now mutes all devices,
   instead of just setting the volume of the first device it finds to zero.
   If the Mute-Button is locked via Group Policies, WinMute will try to
   use the Volume Slider to "emulate" sound muting.

 * XP: Actively tries to prevent other programs from unmuting the system.

Version 1.2 (2011-05-30)

 * Fixed a bug where WinMute could malfunction if the audio
   device was changed or disconnected during a windows session.

Version 0.0 - 1.1
