 * Fixed a problem that WinMute never unmutes, when the PC bootet during quiet hours.
 * Fixed bluetooth muting description
 * Changed SetCoalescableTimer to SetTimer, so WinMute can run under Windows 7.
   Please note that Windows 7 is nevertheless not supported any more.

Version 2.2.0 (2022-11-28)
 * Removed screensaver detection as it caused problems with
   anti-cheat software of current games (e.g. Overwatch 2, Darktide).

Version 2.1.2 (2022-08-25)
 * Changed bluetooth detection logic, so that muting
   the workstation doesn't happen, when scanning for new
   devices.
 * Fixed crash when connectiong via remote desktop
 * Show log-file path in settings UI
 * Enhanced logging

Version 2.1.1 (2022-08-03)
 * Improved UI when WLAN or Bluetooth is not available
 * Added a 5 second delay before unmuting the workstation,
   when a bluetooth device reconnects. This should prevent
   music blasting out of your pc, when the device is connected,
   but the audio endpoint has not been changed yet.
 * Integrated Bluetooth muting into overall mute logic, so that
   the workstation is not unmuted, when it is locked but an audio
   Bluetooth device reconnects.

Version 2.1.0 (2022-08-02)
 * Added new feature to mute workstation when an bluetooth audio device
   disconnects (and re-enable audio if it reconnects)
 * Fixed saving of SSID-lists
 * Fixed some spelling errors

Version 2.0.0 (2022-05-01)
 * WinMute now mutes all audio endpoints and not just the default endpoint.
   It also stores all endpoint states and restores them if the appropriate
   option is set.
 * Reworked mute detection logic. This should fix timing errors, e.g. when
   screensaver with screenlock is active.
 * WinMute can now mute your computer when it is connected (alternatively
   when it is _not_ connected) to a particular wireless network.
 * Added detection for display standby
 * Added detection for RDP sessions
 * Added autostart option (no more fiddling with the Startup-folder)
 * Added Hi-DPI awareness
 * Added tray icon for bright system theme
 * UI Rework (New settings and about dialogue)
 * Various fixes and improvements
 * Updated project to VS 2022

Version 1.6.0 (2020-12-18)
 * Added "Quiet Hours": A time frame where WinMute automatically
   mutes and afterwards unmutes your workstation.
 * Added proxy process to recognize screensaver startup when
   the current foreground application is a 32-bit application
 * Removed 32-bit build.

Version 1.5.0 (2020-06-29)
 * Added support for mute on suspend, shutdown and logout
   Automatic audio-restore is disabled for these events.

Version 1.4.6 (2020-04-24)
 * Compiled with spectre migitations... just 'cause
 * Added "Support"-Link to About dialog
 * Small menu redesign.

Version 1.4.5 (2019-09-04)
 * Fixed crash when all audio endpoints are removed while the program is running
   (might happen, when connecting to your PC via RDP).
 * Upgraded compiler toolset to VS2019

Version 1.4.4 (2017-08-14)
 * New, simpler icon
 * System notification area icon is now white, to fit better with
   with windows' default icons
 * Upgraded compiler toolset to VS2017

Version 1.4.3 (2016-08-11)
 * Maintenance release, no new features
 * Upgraded to new compiler toolset
 * Removed Windows XP as I can also no longer test it and as Visual Studio 2015
   no longer supports this platform.
 * Use more modern UI elements

Version 1.4.1/1.4.2 (2014-07-17)
 * Fixed screensaver muting: It sometimes happened that WinMute
   muted Windows Audio for no apparent reason and "forgot" to
   unmute. This is now fixed.

Version 1.4 (2014-07-10)
 * WinMute can now also mute if the screensaver starts
   Due to windows restrictions, unmuting the audio can take up to one second
   after the screensaver resumes.
 * Added a toggle switch to configure if WinMute should unmute at all after
   a workstation lock or a screensaver run

Version 1.3 (2012-02-23)
 * Right-click menu is now correctly dismissed if the user clicks somewhere
   outside of the menu.
 * Embedded Visual C++ 2010 DLLs. This increases file size by about 100kb, but
   enables the usage of this tool in workplaces that do not have deployed the
   Visual C++ 2010 Runtime Environment yet.
 * Vista/7/8: Correctly mute the new device, if the default audio endpoint
   changes.
 * XP: Greatly improved hardware detection code. WinMute now mutes all devices,
   instead of just setting the volume of the first device it finds to zero.
   If the Mute-Button is locked via Group Policies, WinMute will try to
   use the Volume Slider to "emulate" sound muting.
 * XP: Actively tries to prevent other programs from unmuting the system.

Version 1.2 (2011-05-30)
 * Fixed a bug where WinMute could malfunction if the audio
   device was changed or disconnected during a windows session.

Version 0.0 - 1.1
 * These documents have been lost forever...
