   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>WinMute can automatically mute your volume when</p>
   <ol>
    <li>You lock your PC.</li>
    <li>The screensaver turns on.</li>
    <li>Your PC shuts down</li>
    <li>You log off</li>
    <li>Your PC goes to sleep</li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      This is very helpful e.g. if you leave your desk and don't want
      to annoy your co-workers with random sounds or music from
      your computer or don't want music blasting out of your speakers,
      the next time you power on your pc during a presentation.

   <h2>Requirements</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Operating System
         <ul>
            <li>Windows Vista or newer</li>
            <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads">Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable</a> (might already be installed on your Windows system)</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Installation</h2>
   <p>Unzip it to your favourite directory and you are all set up ;)</p>
   <p>
      If you want WinMute to automatically start with your windows,
      just create a shortcut to the winmute.exe file in the "Startup"
      folder located in your Windows Startmenu (to open this folder,
      press Win+R and enter "Shell:Startup", then click "OK").
   </p>

   <h2>Uninstalling WinMute</h2>
   <p>
      Just delete the WinMute.exe and ScreensaverNotify.dll* file from your hard drive.
      If you want to also remove your personal WinMute settings, then open
      the registry (regedit.exe) and delete the Folder located in
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\lx-systems\WinMute.
   </p>
   <p>
    * It can happen, that you cannot remove this DLL file right away.
      If you get an error trying to remove it, just wait until your next reboot
      and delete it afterwards. This is unfortunately a windows limitation.
   </p>

   <h2>Usage</h2>
   <p>Start it and that's it!</p>
   <p>
      Whenever you lock your screen from now on or the screensaver starts,
      WinMute will automatically mute your windows volume, and unmute it
      right away when you come back to your pc.<br>
      If you want to disable this behaviour temporary, right-click
      on the taskbar notification icon and uncheck the menu item
      "Mute on Workstationlock" / "Mute on Screensaver start".
