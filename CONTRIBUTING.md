# How To Contribute

## New Features

If you have the next great idea for this little tool, you are welcome to open an
issues with your idea. This is how WiFi- and Bluetooth-based muting came to life ðŸ™‚

If your idea is too big for the scope of this tool or I don't have the time to
implement it, I'll let you know and you are free to provide a PR with the code,
if you have the time to provide the code yourself.

## Bug fixes

You're welcome at any time to provide pull requests with fixes for bugs you discovered.
Try to keep it in the current coding style as much as possible. Otherwise I won't
dictate any strict rules.

## Art

Since my artistic competence is hovering right around the skill level of "programmer art",
a new program icon suitable for Windows' light and dark theme (or GitHubs README) would be greatly appreciated ðŸ™‚

## Internationalization

WinMute would greatly benefit from transalation. As of now WinMute does not support
any form of i18n.
If you know how to best implement i18n in a simple WinAPI app, I'd be happy if you
could help out with implementing the basic infrastructure for it.
